# Bio-Data-Entry-Portal-GUI
This is an improved version of the Data Entry Portal GUI App. 
It is a Bio-Data Entry Portal Dashboard.
It is built with Python library tKinter and sqlite. 
This dashboard allows the user to write to a database, query the database, delete records from the database using their unique record ID and also update the records using that ID.
